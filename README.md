## Improving Diagnosis/Prognosis Accuracy in Alzheimer’s Disease Patients: Drugs, Supplements, and Tau Protein Levels Are Important Predictors

Final Project Report for AC209a - Introduction to Data Science

Official Group #46: Carlo Amadei, Hsiang Hsu, Rebecca Stern, Thomas Hsueh

### REPORT OVERVIEW 
This project aims to evaluate the interaction between taking Calcium supplements, Vitamin D supplements, and blood-thinning medications on the development of AD. We also examine the influence of tau protein levels on the development of AD. 

### Problem Statement and Motivation
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a degenerative brain disease and the most common cause of dementia, and AD rates are increasing annually . As of 2006, the global prevalence of AD was 26.6 million, and this figure is expected to increase four-fold by 2050. In the United States in 2016, AD was the sixth leading cause of death. From 2000-2013, deaths from AD increased 71% – this rise was larger than the increase in deaths from stroke (+23%) and heart disease (+14%) during the same time period. <br /><br />

Given the debilitating nature of AD, the widespread and rising prevalence of this disease, and the increasing lifespan of human population, efforts to mitigate the incidence and damaged caused by AD in the future are imperative. A crucial step toward achieving this end is to understand the risk factors associated with AD; however, such predictive features are currently not well constrained. According to the U.S. 2017 Alzheimer’s Disease Facts and Figures: <br /><br />

“Although the research that followed has revealed a great deal about Alzheimer’s, much is yet to be 
discovered about the precise biological changes that cause the disease, why it progresses more quickly
in some than in others, and how the disease can be prevented, slowed or stopped.” 
```

The clinical challenge in diagnosing AD arises because early forms of the disease do not present motor, sensory, or coordination deficits, and laboratory tests are not determinative. Machine learning algorithms and statistical modeling offer a potential avenue to overcome part of this challenge by diagnose early AD: by leveraging multiple data sources, combining test results based on neuropsychological, genetic, and biomarker indicators, among others, statistical models could generate AD diagnoses with higher accuracy than using each of the features alone. <br /><br />

In this report, we evaluate improvements in the accuracy of AD diagnosis generated by considering clinical variables that have not been used in the majority of previous studies. Specifically, we investigate the relationship between AD diagnosis and a patient’s medications (e.g., Calcium supplements, Vitamin D supplements, blood-thinning medications, cholesterol-lowering drugs). We also evaluate the relative importance of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) total tau (t-tau) peptide levels and CSF amyloid-Beta (a-B); to date, the majority of clinical research has focused on a-B, however suggestions from Dr. Sally Temple, a neuroscience researcher with expertise in neurodegenerative disease. According to Dr. Temple, “  ____to_fill_in_______  .” 

### DATA DESCRIPTION
Our analysis of the ADNI2 data focuses on contributions related to diagnosis and progression of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) properties. Importantly, the medications we examine are not on the list of medications that lead to exclusion from the ADNI cohort. We begin with the ADNIMERGE.csv as our primary data resource, with particular emphasis on the clinical components. ADNIMERGE is comprised of information on all patients from different ADNI phases (i.e., ADNI1, ADNI2, ADNIGO). To maintain consistency across our analyses and manageability of the data, we select only the patients who participated in the ADNI2 phase of the Initiative. In the ADNI2 observations, each row corresponds to an exam of a patient (“RID”, the patient identifier), and specific visit; multiple rows can refer to the same patient for different visits. It is possible to see a differentiation in baseline visit (‘bl’) predictors and predictors that refers to later visits. There are 94 columns in the dataset, the majority of which correspond to independent variables that could be assessed at each exam. There are two diagnosis features that correspond to diagnosis at baseline and diagnosis at a later visit. All diagnoses entries correspond to assignment into one of five diagnostic groups: Cognitively Normal (CN), Normal Control (NC), Subjective Memory Concern (SMC), MCI (Mild cognitive impairment), EMCI (Early Mildly Cognitively Impaired), Late Mildly Cognitively Impaired (LMCI, or classic MCI), and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). We also interpret the meaning of each of the columns via consultation of the ADNIMERGE_DICT.csv, Data FAQs from the ADNI website, an ADNI training powerpoint, and the ADNI2 procedures manual. In addition to the data exploration, we also made qualitative observations about the dataset, including our concerns about potential limitations of the study, including the way the data was collected, potential collinearity, etc.
